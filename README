- What's this ?

This is the extension library to access a PostgreSQL database from Ruby.
This library works with PostgreSQL 6.5/7.0/7.1/7.2; it probably works 
with 6.3 or earlier with slight modification, but not tested at all.

- Requirements

  Ruby 1.3.4 or later.
  PostgreSQL 6.4/6.5/7.0/7.1/7.2 installed.

- How to install ?

Follow the instructions below to compile and install:

  ruby extconf.rb
  make
  su              (if necessary)
  make install

You may need to specify the directory name for the include files and the
-lpq library by using

    --with-pgsql-include-dir=<include file directory>
    --with-pgsql-lib-dir=<library directory>
 or 
    --with-pgsql-dir=<dir>
      Same as --with-pgsql-include-dir=<dir>/include,
      --with-pgsql-lib-dir=<dir>/lib


For example:

  ruby extconf.rb --with-pgsql-include-dir=/usr/local/pgsql/include \
                  --with-pgsql-lib-dir=/usr/local/pgsql/lib
or
  ruby extconf.rb --with-pgsql-dir=/usr/local/pgsql/

- How to use ?

You need to specify:

  require "postgres"

at the top of your script.

- What functions can I use ?
